## Usage

ssf-app is built on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/), so you will need to get some Javascript running on your computer to execute it.

First, make sure you have Node.js 18 installed (older versions might work, but not tested).
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a popular choice for that.  
Then, you will need to install a few dependencies, and start the project:
```bash
# Use Node.js version 18
nvm use 18

# Download the current version of ssf-app
git clone https://github.com/kongr45gpen/ssf-app.git
cd ssf-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start ssf-app development server at port :3000
npm start
```
